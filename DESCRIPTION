Description: Functionality for performing a principled reference analysis in the Bayesian normal-normal hierarchical model used for Bayesian meta-analysis, as described in Ott, Plummer and Roos (2021) <doi:10.1002/sim.9076>. Computes a reference posterior, induced by a minimally informative improper reference prior for the between-study (heterogeneity) standard deviation. Determines additional proper anti-conservative (and conservative) prior benchmarks. Includes functions for reference analyses at both the posterior and the prior level, which, given the data, quantify the informativeness of a heterogeneity prior of interest relative to the minimally informative reference prior and the proper prior benchmarks. The functions operate on data sets which are compatible with the 'bayesmeta' package.
